1.193     2014-03-26 22:29:28-04:00 America/New_York
        - improve behavior on CNAME MX records

1.192     2013-09-07 21:00:55 America/New_York
          if Net::DNS is not available, do not test null mx validity

1.191     2013-09-04 21:52:50 America/New_York
          update bugtracker, repo, etc.

          mxcheck fails when remote MX record is "."

          drop use of bytes.pm; any bug fixed by that should be fixed again
          properly

0.190     2012-03-26
          fix skip test count

0.189     2012-03-26
          addresses in the form rjbs@[1.2.3.4], when allowed by allow_ip,
          are not failed for the tld check (reported by Marcel Grünauer)

0.188     2012-03-15
          fix [rt.cpan.org #75736], in which 0@domain.com was considered
          invalid (thanks for the fix from Steve Bertrand)

0.187     2012-01-27
          addresses in the form rjbs@[1.2.3.4] are now (correctly) considered
          valid; this can be disabled with the -allow_ip option
          (this resolves RT #48398)

          check email address length and localpart length (thanks, Steve
          Bertrand!)

0.186     2012-01-22
          use blessed($x) instead of wrapping an ->isa called in eval{}; this
          patch (thanks, Felipe Bergo!) was submitted to avoid problems with
          people who have global __DIE__ handlers, but was applied to just
          avoid the dumb eval{}; people with __DIE__ are otherwise on their
          own, here

0.185     2011-08-11
          do not die in t/valid.t when testing for working DNS

          avoid a pointless warning (mentioned in RT #68312)

          check TLD validity before MX records
          (address RT #32237, thanks, meyerdigital)

          reject addresses with non-ASCII characters
          (address RT #50230, thanks, ferreira)

0.184     2010-06-10

        replace UNIVERSAL:: with eval{}-wrapping

        Only load Net::DNS module if required

0.12    Thu Jul  8 22:26:41 PDT 1999
        Added details() method to determine why an address check fails.
          Thanks to Otis Gospodnetic for the suggestion.      
        Global Net::DNS::Resolver object is now used for DNS queries when
          Net::DNS is available.  Can be accessed directly to tweak the
          resolver behavior.
        The address() method now returns an additional value (an instance of
          the Mail::Address class) when called in a list context.  
        Updated documentation.

0.11    Wed Jul  7 04:33:58 PDT 1999

        Added Mail::Address to PREREQ_PM to list dependency, as suggested by
          Achim.
        Moved test.pl to t/valid.t as suggested by Achim.
        DNS lookups now use Net::DNS if available, falling back to nslookup if
          not.  Suggested by Lupe Christoph.
        Modified documentation
        Renamed Email::Valid::NSLookup to Email::Valid::DNS, which is now
          responsible for all DNS queries.

0.07    Tue Jan 12 02:04:57 PST 1999
        Mail::Address module is now required
        Added Email::Valid::NSLookup module to encapsulate DNS lookups -- now
          we can add additional classes to use other utilities.
        Fixed problem with spaces thanks to David Birnbaum.
        Renamed a couple of the parameters -- old names should still work.
