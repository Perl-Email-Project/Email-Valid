        - improve detection of "no MXes" (thanks, Troy Morehouse)

        - yhaoo.com grew an MX record; use something that won't

        - improve behavior on CNAME MX records

          if Net::DNS is not available, do not test null mx validity

1.191     2013-09-04 21:52:50 America/New_York
          update bugtracker, repo, etc.

          mxcheck fails when remote MX record is "."

          drop use of bytes.pm; any bug fixed by that should be fixed again
          properly

0.190     2012-03-26
          fix skip test count

0.189     2012-03-26
          addresses in the form rjbs@[1.2.3.4], when allowed by allow_ip,
          are not failed for the tld check (reported by Marcel GrÃ¼nauer)

0.188     2012-03-15
          fix [rt.cpan.org #75736], in which 0@domain.com was considered
          invalid (thanks for the fix from Steve Bertrand)

0.187     2012-01-27
          addresses in the form rjbs@[1.2.3.4] are now (correctly) considered
          valid; this can be disabled with the -allow_ip option
          (this resolves RT #48398)

          check email address length and localpart length (thanks, Steve
          Bertrand!)

0.186     2012-01-22
          use blessed($x) instead of wrapping an ->isa called in eval{}; this
          patch (thanks, Felipe Bergo!) was submitted to avoid problems with
          people who have global __DIE__ handlers, but was applied to just
          avoid the dumb eval{}; people with __DIE__ are otherwise on their
          own, here

0.185     2011-08-11

        Added details() method to determine why an address check fails.
          Thanks to Otis Gospodnetic for the suggestion.      
        Global Net::DNS::Resolver object is now used for DNS queries when
          Net::DNS is available.  Can be accessed directly to tweak the
          resolver behavior.
        The address() method now returns an additional value (an instance of
          the Mail::Address class) when called in a list context.  
        Updated documentation.

          not.  Suggested by Lupe Christoph.
        Modified documentation
        Renamed Email::Valid::NSLookup to Email::Valid::DNS, which is now
          responsible for all DNS queries.

          we can add additional classes to use other utilities.
        Fixed problem with spaces thanks to David Birnbaum.
